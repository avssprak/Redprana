## Tech Stack — Non-Negotiable

```
Vite 5+
React 18
TypeScript (strict mode)
Tailwind CSS 3
Framer Motion 11
React Router DOM v6
react-helmet-async (SEO meta tags)
lucide-react (icons only — no other icon library)
```

**Deployment**: Build locally → upload `dist/` contents to GoDaddy cPanel `public_html/`

---

## Coding Rules

### Always
- Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Named exports for components, default export for pages
- Tailwind classes only — no inline styles, no CSS modules
- Mobile-first responsive (sm → md → lg → xl)
- Every image: `alt` text, `loading="lazy"`, `width`/`height` attributes
- Every interactive element: keyboard accessible, ARIA labels
- React Router `<Link>` for internal navigation (never `<a>` for internal routes)
- `react-helmet-async` for every page's `<title>` and meta description

### Never
- No inline CSS (`style={{}}`)
- No Bootstrap, no MUI, no Chakra, no Ant Design
- No jQuery
- No class components
- No `any` TypeScript type without a comment explaining why
- No hardcoded colours outside Tailwind config
- No placeholder Lorem Ipsum — write real, enterprise-grade copy

---

## Design System

### Colour Palette (defined in tailwind.config.ts)

```
primary:          #0B1220  (near-black navy — headings, nav background)
primary-light:    #1a2540  (lighter navy — hover states on dark backgrounds)
secondary:        #0E7490  (deep teal — section accents, borders)
secondary-light:  #0891b2  (lighter teal — hover states)
accent:           #2563EB  (blue — primary buttons, links, highlights)
accent-light:     #3b82f6  (lighter blue — hover states)
accent-warm:      #C2410C  (burnt orange — Red Prana brand warmth, sparingly)
success:          #10B981  (green — positive indicators)
surface:          #F8FAFC  (off-white — page background)
surface-dark:     #0F172A  (dark sections — footer, hero)
text:             #111827  (body text)
text-muted:       #6B7280  (secondary text, captions)
text-inverse:     #F9FAFB  (text on dark backgrounds)
```

**Brand rationale**: Navy + Teal = enterprise authority. Burnt orange (`accent-warm`) is the
"Prana" warmth — used sparingly on the logo mark, hover states, and one accent element per page.
This prevents the site looking like every other govtech site.

### Typography (loaded via Google Fonts in index.html)

```
Display / Headings:  'Poppins', weight 600, 700
Body:                'Inter', weight 400, 500
Mono / Data:         'JetBrains Mono', weight 400 (for framework codes, version numbers)
```

### Custom Font Sizes
- `text-display-xl` — 4.5rem / line-height 1.1 (hero headlines)
- `text-display-lg` — 3.75rem / line-height 1.15 (page titles)
- `text-display-md` — 3rem / line-height 1.2 (section headings)

### Background Utilities
- `bg-hero-pattern` — dual radial gradient (teal + blue), use on hero dark sections

### Spacing Scale
Follow Tailwind defaults. Section padding: `py-20 lg:py-28`. Container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`.

### Border Radius
- Cards: `rounded-2xl`
- Buttons: `rounded-full` (primary), `rounded-lg` (secondary)
- Badges/tags: `rounded-full`

### Shadows (custom — defined in tailwind.config.ts)
- Cards: `shadow-card hover:shadow-card-hover transition-shadow`
- Hero elements: `shadow-2xl`
- Glow effects: `shadow-glow-teal`, `shadow-glow-blue` (use on hover for interactive elements)

### Animation Principles (Framer Motion)
- Page transitions: `fadeIn` with `y: 20 → 0`, duration `0.5s`
- Stagger children: `staggerChildren: 0.1`
- Scroll-triggered: use `whileInView` with `once: true`
- Hover: `whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}` on cards
- **No** looping animations on load — feels unserious to enterprise buyers
- **Exception**: `CenterFlame` in `CompassRing.tsx` has a subtle pulsing glow (`repeat: Infinity`) — this is intentional as a brand element, not a page-load animation

---

## Signature Element — Framework Compass

**This is the one unique element that makes this site memorable.**

Location: Hero section of the Home page AND a full section on the Frameworks page.

Description: An interactive SVG/Canvas visual showing a compass or radial diagram with
4 framework nodes:

```
       NIST AI RMF
           ↑
MAS ←——[ CORE ]——→ EU AI Act
           ↓
       ISO 42001
```

Each node is clickable and expands to show:
- Framework name + jurisdiction
- Key requirements summary (3 bullet points)
- How Red Prana maps services to this framework
- "Learn more" link to Frameworks page

The compass rotates subtly on scroll (Framer Motion `useScroll`).
On the Frameworks page, it expands to a full interactive reference tool.

**Implementation note**: Build this as `<FrameworkCompass />` component in `src/components/FrameworkCompass/`.
It must be fully keyboard accessible (Tab through nodes, Enter to expand).
